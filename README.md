Potato Leaf Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

Developed and compared two convolutional neural network (CNN) models using Keras: a ResNet50 model and a custom-designed model, with the latter achieving superior accuracy.
The first Notebook has a general Deep Learning Model, and the second uses the ResNet50 Transfer Learning Model.
